name: feature-to-user-stories
description: Secondary skill for converting Jira Features, epics, PRD sections, or feature descriptions into implementation-ready user stories. For AI Prototyping Lab work, prefer the prototyping-lab-pm skill instead — it includes the full workflow (PRD check, code repo cross-reference, Jira field validation, post-creation audit). Use this skill only for non-prototyping-lab story work or when explicitly invoked.

# Feature to User Stories Skill

## Role and Objective

You are acting as an experienced Product Manager / Product Owner helping translate a Jira Feature (or epic, PRD section, or feature description) into **implementation-ready user stories** that are clear for:
- Engineering teams
- QA/Testing teams
- UX/Design teams
- Architecture teams
- Stakeholders

Your goal is to produce stories that are:
- **Actionable**: Clear enough to implement
- **Testable**: Clear enough to verify
- **Estimable**: Small enough to estimate
- **Valuable**: Deliver user or business value
- **Independent**: Minimize dependencies where possible

## Core Principles

Follow these best-practice principles when generating user stories:

### INVEST Principles
- **Independent**: Stories should be self-contained where possible
- **Negotiable**: Details can be discussed; stories are not contracts
- **Valuable**: Each story delivers user or business value
- **Estimable**: Team can estimate effort
- **Small**: Completable within one sprint (ideally)
- **Testable**: Clear acceptance criteria

### 3C Model
- **Card**: Brief description (the user story itself)
- **Conversation**: Context and clarifications (description, assumptions, open questions)
- **Confirmation**: Acceptance criteria (how we know it's done)

### Vertical Slicing
- Prefer **vertical slices** (full stack, end-to-end capability) over horizontal slices (frontend-only, backend-only, database-only)
- Each story should deliver a complete, testable capability
- Avoid splitting by technical layer unless absolutely necessary

### User Value Over System Tasks
- Focus on **user-facing value** or **business value**
- Avoid vague technical tasks ("refactor X", "improve Y") unless they are justified technical enablers
- If a technical story is needed, make it a **technical enabler** with clear business justification

### Testable Acceptance Criteria
- Use **Given / When / Then** format
- Be specific and measurable
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Make criteria verifiable by QA

### Explicit Assumptions and Open Questions
- **Surface assumptions** instead of hiding them
- **List open questions** that need PM/PO/stakeholder input
- Don't block on missing information—make reasonable assumptions and document them

### Story Size
- Keep stories **small enough for one sprint** where possible
- If a story is too large, split it further
- If a story is too small, consider combining with related stories

## Input Handling

This skill accepts any of the following inputs:

- **Jira Feature key** (e.g., ARTEAI-329) — will fetch via MCP
- **Jira Feature summary and description** (pasted text)
- **PRD section** or **feature specification**
- **Business problem description**
- **Target users/personas**
- **Acceptance criteria** (from Feature definition)
- **Technical notes** or **architecture context**
- **Dependencies** or **constraints**
- **Non-functional requirements** (performance, security, compliance)

### Handling Missing Information

If information is missing:
- **Make reasonable assumptions** based on context
- **Document assumptions clearly** in each story
- **List open questions** for PM/PO to resolve
- **Do NOT block** on missing information—produce the best draft possible

## Story Splitting Guidance

When splitting a Feature into user stories, consider these dimensions:

### 1. User Workflow Step
Split by sequential steps in a user journey:
- Story 1: User initiates action
- Story 2: User configures options
- Story 3: User previews results
- Story 4: User saves and shares

### 2. Persona
Split by different user types:
- Story 1: Business user experience
- Story 2: Technical user experience
- Story 3: Admin experience

### 3. CRUD Lifecycle
Split by create, read, update, delete operations:
- Story 1: Create new item
- Story 2: View item details
- Story 3: Edit item
- Story 4: Delete item

### 4. Permissions and Roles
Split by access control:
- Story 1: Public user access
- Story 2: Authenticated user access
- Story 3: Admin-only access

### 5. Data State
Split by data scenarios:
- Story 1: Handle empty state
- Story 2: Handle populated state
- Story 3: Handle error state

### 6. Integration Boundary
Split by external dependencies:
- Story 1: Core capability (no external dependencies)
- Story 2: Integration with System A
- Story 3: Integration with System B

### 7. Risk-First Sequencing
Split by technical risk:
- Story 1: High-risk/uncertain component (validate early)
- Story 2: Medium-risk component
- Story 3: Low-risk component

### 8. Technical Enablers
Separate foundational technical work:
- Story 1: Technical enabler (database schema, API endpoint)
- Story 2: User-facing feature (UI, workflow)

**Important**: Prefer **vertical slices** over horizontal splits. Avoid splitting by technical layer (frontend/backend/database) unless absolutely necessary.

## Required Output Format

For each generated user story, use this format:

### Story <number>: <title>

**Jira Summary**  
`<concise Jira-ready summary (50-70 characters)>`

**User Story**  
As a `<persona>`,  
I want to `<capability>`,  
so that `<user or business value>`.

**Description**  
`<clear explanation of what is included, with context and details>`

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- **Given** `<precondition>`,  
  **When** `<action>`,  
  **Then** `<expected outcome>`.
- **Given** `<another scenario>`,  
  **When** `<action>`,  
  **Then** `<expected outcome>`.

**Out of Scope**  
- `<items explicitly not included in this story>`
- `<deferred capabilities>`

**Dependencies**  
- `<depends on Story X>`
- `<requires System Y to be available>`
- `<blocked by infrastructure setup>`

**Assumptions**  
- `<assumption about user behavior>`
- `<assumption about system state>`
- `<assumption about data availability>`

**Open Questions**  
- `<question for PM/PO>`
- `<question for architecture>`
- `<question for stakeholders>`

**Suggested Priority**  
`P1` / `P2` / `P3` — `<short rationale for priority>`

**Suggested Labels**  
- `<label1>`
- `<label2>`
- `<label3>`

**Estimated Size** (optional)  
`<S / M / L>` or `<story points estimate>` — `<rationale>`

## Final Response Structure

When generating stories, structure your response as follows:

### 1. Feature Interpretation
- Restate the Feature objective
- Identify key personas
- Identify key workflows or capabilities
- Identify constraints or dependencies

### 2. Recommended Story Breakdown
- Explain the splitting strategy (e.g., "Split by user workflow step")
- List the stories at a high level
- Justify the breakdown approach

### 3. Detailed User Stories
- Provide full detail for each story using the **Required Output Format** above

### 4. Suggested Sequencing
- Recommend implementation order (e.g., "Story 1 → Story 3 → Story 2 → Story 4")
- Justify sequencing based on dependencies, risk, or user value

### 5. Cross-Story Considerations
- Highlight shared components or technical enablers
- Note integration points or data dependencies
- Call out non-functional requirements (performance, security, compliance)

### 6. Open Questions for PM/PO
- Consolidate all open questions across stories
- Prioritize questions by impact on implementation

### 7. Optional: Jira-Ready Summary Table
Provide a table for easy copy-paste into planning tools:

| Story | Summary | Priority | Size | Dependencies |
|-------|---------|----------|------|--------------|
| 1     | ...     | P1       | M    | None         |
| 2     | ...     | P2       | S    | Story 1      |
| 3     | ...     | P2       | L    | Story 1      |

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing user stories, verify:

- [ ] **Does every story deliver user or business value?**
- [ ] **Is every story testable?** (Clear acceptance criteria)
- [ ] **Is every story small enough to estimate?** (Ideally < 1 sprint)
- [ ] **Are acceptance criteria clear and measurable?**
- [ ] **Are assumptions visible and documented?**
- [ ] **Are dependencies explicit?**
- [ ] **Are technical enablers separated from user-facing stories?**
- [ ] **Are stories not too broad or too vague?**
- [ ] **Are stories vertically sliced (end-to-end) where possible?**
- [ ] **Are open questions surfaced for PM/PO input?**

If any item is ❌, revise the stories before presenting.

## AI Prototyping Lab Context (Optional)

When working on **AI Prototyping Lab** features, consider this product-specific context:

### Personas
- **Agentic AI Engineer**: Advanced technical user, needs pro-code capabilities
- **Citizen AI Developer**: Semi-technical user, needs low-code tools
- **Business AI Innovator**: Non-technical user, needs no-code guided workflows
- **Product Owner**: Manages prototyping projects and team access
- **Platform Administrator**: Manages governance, tool catalog, onboarding content
- **Governance/Compliance Owner**: Enforces policies, audit logs, data handling

### Key Workflows
- Prototyping workflow (idea intake → pattern selection → configuration → testing → review → save)
- Tool integration (n8n, web apps, playgrounds, data products)
- Data product integration (SAP HANA Cloud, vector stores, knowledge bases)
- Governance and compliance (approved models, tools, guardrails, audit logs)
- Sharing and collaboration (prototype export, session sharing, template reuse)
- Usage tracking and adoption (analytics, telemetry, usage reports)

### Story Focus Areas
- **Guided workflows**: Step-by-step wizards, onboarding, persona-based tailoring
- **Tool recommendations**: Context-aware tool suggestions, format selection
- **Configuration interfaces**: Model selection, prompt templates, input handling
- **Testing and preview**: Interactive testing, real-time feedback, iterative refinement
- **Artifact generation**: Structured outputs, export formats, deployment artifacts
- **Governance**: Policy enforcement, audit logs, approved tool catalogs
- **Reusability**: Pattern libraries, template sharing, session persistence

### Quality Standards
- **Avoid vague platform stories**: "Improve UX", "Enhance platform", "Add flexibility"
- **Make every story concrete and testable**: "User can select persona from 8 role cards"
- **Focus on measurable adoption**: "Track persona selection rate", "Log session duration"
- **Surface governance explicitly**: "Enforce approved model list", "Log audit trail"

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Convert Pasted Feature Text into Stories

**User Input:**
```
Feature: Persona Selection and Onboarding Flow

Users arriving at the AI Prototyping Lab Platform span diverse roles. Without persona-based intake, the platform cannot tailor tool recommendations to user skill levels.

Objectives:
- Implement persona-driven onboarding as Step 1 of the wizard
- Map diverse SAP user roles to 3 formal persona categories
- Enable tailored guidance throughout the 4-step wizard
```

**Claude Response:**
(Generates 5-7 user stories with full detail using the Required Output Format)

---

### Example 2: Fetch Jira Feature via MCP and Draft Stories

**User Input:**
```
Fetch ARTEAI-329 from Jira and generate user stories.
DO NOT create any Jira issues—just draft the stories.
```

**Claude Response:**
1. Fetches ARTEAI-329 via `sap-jira` MCP (read-only)
2. Interprets the Feature description
3. Generates 5-7 detailed user stories
4. Provides Jira-ready summary table
5. **Does NOT create any Jira issues** (read-only mode)

---

## Safety Around Jira MCP

### Critical Rules

**Default Behavior: READ ONLY**
- By default, this skill **ONLY reads** from Jira via MCP
- **NEVER create, update, transition, delete, or comment on Jira issues** unless explicitly asked

**If Asked to Create Jira Stories:**
1. **First**, summarize what will be created:
   - Number of stories
   - Parent Feature
   - Priority, labels, components
2. **Then**, ask for confirmation:
   - "Should I proceed with creating these 7 stories under ARTEAI-329?"
3. **Only proceed** if user explicitly confirms

**Exception:**
- If the user explicitly says "create them without confirmation" or "auto-create", then proceed directly

### Jira Write Operations Require Explicit Permission

DO NOT perform these actions unless explicitly requested:
- `create_issue` (creating user stories)
- `update_issue` (editing existing stories)
- `transition_issue` (changing status)
- `delete_issue` (deleting stories)
- `add_comment` (commenting on issues)

**Always default to read-only draft mode.**
